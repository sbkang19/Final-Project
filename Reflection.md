This was my last project in Computer Programmin 2.
I couldn't finish my last group project, which was to make ciphers, so I decided to work on it, and finish it.
I was interested at making this program because I thought I can use my program in my real life, and it would be fun.

First of all, I got information about ciphers from a website (https://inventwithpython.com/chapter14.html), and I tried to use code from it, but I tried to find other ways to create the code. So I went to a different website to create encrypting code. The website (http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher), and there was code I was finding. However, it had encrypting and decrypting code in one program, and I wanted to make 2 separate program. So I chaned some codes including variables, and lines.
